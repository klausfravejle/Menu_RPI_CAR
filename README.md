# Menu_RPI_CAR
This project, was created as an learning experiment, I was to create a Remote controlled car, using my Raspberry Pi and python. 
I wanted to get full video from webcam

I made the setup using GPIO pins, some High amps DC motor controller with 5v for the RPI.
I had an old webca, so I used that one, until the real RPI webcam came from china.
